Sometimes it puts the opening braces on the same line, sometimes it puts it\r\non the next line. I prefer it to be on the opening line.\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\n### From Rubygems\r\n\r\n    $ gem install fixbraces\r\n\r\n### From source\r\n\r\nClone the repository and then build and install it:\r\n\r\n    rake install\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n\r\nOnce it is installed, you can run it from the command line.
